Project Two

## Project Requirements
- Provide a authentification screen. 

- After the user presses the button, read the content of the text boxes. If there is input in each text input, declare the user ‘authenticated.’ Pass this to the console via console.log.

- Set a cookie

- After the cookie is set, navigate the user automatically. We will call this the landing page, and it should be a page you have already built in your project 1.

- When the visitor reaches your landing page, read the cookie. If the cookie says they are authenticated, show an alert that says, ‘welcome back’.
